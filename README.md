# ANNPoweredTicTacToe
This was our semester project for Fall 2022.
We were required to create an Artificial Neural Network that utilizes the dataset provided (by the instructor) to train the system to play TicTacToe against a player.
Utilizing Vectors, and a home-made library, we created an Artifical Neural Network in C++, complete with the system being utilized to play TicTacToe.
The file consists of 4 header files, one C++ file, and a .dat file.
